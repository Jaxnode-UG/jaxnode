        "description": "What is Svelte? Svelte is a JavaScript framework (actually, a compiler) to build UI in the browser (solves the same problem as React, Vue, Angular, etc.). Very easy to learn (3-4 hours). It's just standard HTML+JavaScript. No new syntax to learn. It's truly reactive - unlike other frameworks, you don't have to tell the framework to modify state, you just do it and the compiler knows It's a compiler, not a framework -- which means most work is done at build time, which produces faster and smaller code It has no runtime libraries -- it just uses browser APIs It doesn't use Virtual DOM -- it works on the real browser DOM, but efficiently",
