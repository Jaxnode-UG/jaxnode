        "description": "Apple just released their SwiftUI framework in iOS 13, tvOS 13, watchOS 5 and the soon to be released macOS Catalina. SwiftUI is Apple's reactive UI framework for building user interfaces with less code. If you have used React or React Native, this framework should look familiar to you because it uses many of the same paradigms as React. \n David Fekke will be giving this presentation on the SwiftUI framework. He will cover SwiftUI and the Combine framework, as well some of Google's plans with their Compose framework. David is the chief Mobile Architect for Swyft Technology and the organizer for the JaxNode User Group. \nOn a side note, this will be our last meeting of the year. Please attend if you can.",
